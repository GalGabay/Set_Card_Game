# SET CARD GAME

## ABOUT this project:
This is a virtual edition for the set card game we all know.
In this game, you can play against each other, against the computer, or just run the computers to player against each other!
The game supports concurrency, therefore it is multy-threaded so you can make sure that there will be no mistakes even if all players call a set at the same time.

### HOW TO RUN:
1. You must have Maven installed on your computer.
2. in Terminal: mvn compile
3. in Terminal: mvn exec:java
4. Enjoy!
