BONUS CHALLENGE FORM
--------------------

For each bonus challenge you have implemented, please replace the sentence "We are not entitled to this bonus."
with a short description of:

1. How it was implemented in your code
2. Where it was used (in which class methods).
3. How you tested that it is working correctly.

--------------------

1. Fully supporting all configuration fields and avoiding the use of magic numbers

    1. Instead of using mumbers we used the config file fields by calling "env.config.***"
    2. Dealer: - "PlaceCardsOnTable" 
               - reshuffleTime in TimerLoop and updateTimerDisplay 
               - removeAllCardsFromTable
       Player: - createArtificialIntelligence
               - point
               - penalty
    3. We changed the value of these fields in the config file, then we ran the program and saw the differences. 

--------------------

2. Terminating all threads (that you created) gracefully and in reverse order to the order they were created in.

    1. we created the players threads in a loop running from 0 to players.length. 
    When we terminated the threads we had a loop from players.length to 0(in reverse order to their creation)
    In the player class, inside terminate() we terminated the AI thread(using intterupt) and waited it to 
    terminate(using join) and after that we terminate(using intterupt) and waited 
    the player thread to terminate(using join).
    2. We terminated the player threads in method terminate() in class Dealer.
    AI threads terminated in method terminate() of class Player.
    3. We ran the program and checked in the "logs" file. 
    We saw that the order of the threads creation and the threads termination were in reverse order.

--------------------

3. Handling the config.turnTimeoutMillis value as follows:
config.turnTimeoutMillis < 0: display nothing.
config.turnTimeoutMillis = 0: display a timer since the last action (reshuffle or set collected).
Note: in modes without a countdown timer the dealer must ensure there is always at least one legal set on the table.

We are not entitled to this bonus.

--------------------

4. Making sure that the threads do not wake up unless some actual job needs to be done (e.g., a value needs to be
changed on the display, key input needs to be handled, etc.) and the only threads created by you are:
1 thread per player + 1 additional thread for non-human players.

We are not entitled to this bonus.
